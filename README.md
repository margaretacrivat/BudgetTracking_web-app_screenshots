## About:
Here you can find the screenshots for Budget Tracking web application, which I have developed using Django web 
framework. All backend logic, including the management of data and business logic, is implemented using Python. 
This web app is designed to help users manage both personal budget and project-associated budget, all centralized 
within a single virtual environment. The goal is to provide users with a comprehensive tool to track their expenses, 
set budget limits, and analyze their financial data.
